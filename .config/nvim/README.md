Code (on the left side)

### Prerequisites

- A nerd font
    - I would recommend one with good-looking braille symbols for a nicer looking startup screen (especially if you're also using my build of st, some more feature-rich terminals like kitty aren't affected by this). Check [here](https://www.programmingfonts.org/) to test out monospace programming fonts with a braille character whose empty cells are invisible, not hollow.
- npm
- unzip(?)

### Installation

Move this directory into your ~/.config/nvim folder (if it already exists; create it if not).
